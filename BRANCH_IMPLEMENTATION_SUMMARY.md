- `deps:` - Dependency updates
- Clear, descriptive messages
- Present tense, imperative mood
- Focused on single responsibility

## ðŸ”„ Branch Integration Strategy

### Recommended Merge Order:
1. `feature/dev2-email-service` (foundation)
2. `feature/dev2-notification-system` (depends on email)
3. `feature/dev2-analytics-api` (independent)
4. `feature/dev2-export-enhancement` (independent)

### Integration Commands:
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge each branch in order
git merge feature/dev2-email-service
git merge feature/dev2-notification-system
git merge feature/dev2-analytics-api
git merge feature/dev2-export-enhancement

# Push integrated changes
git push origin main
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Each Branch
